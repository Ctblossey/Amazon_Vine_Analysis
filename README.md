# Amazon Product Reviews
## US Electronics

## Overview
### The overview of this project was to take a deeper look at US electronics reviews. Through PySpark, Python, and SQL, we were able to do our analysis. The analysis consisted of created dataframes for customers, products, reviews, and the Vine program. By creating different dataframes, we were able to create different takeaways.

## Results
### There were three metrics we used to analyze the Vine program: review count, five star rating count, and percentage of five star reviews. The Vine program had 1080 reviews, 454 five star reviews, and 42.04% of reviews being five star reviews. The non-Vine program portion had 49673 reviews, 23043 five star reviews, and 46.39% of the reviews being five star reviews.

## Summary
### Looking at the comparison of Vine and non-Vine reviews, it is hard to say that their is bias one way or the other. Non-Vine reviews had a slightly higher percentage of five star reviews, but the Vine program having roughly the same percentage with much less reviews is very telling. One additional analysis I would perform would be to show the distribution of how many stars the reviews have. It may be that the Vine program has mostly fours and fives and the non-Vine program reviews has a more even distribution. It would be more telling to have all of the review's stars accounted for.
